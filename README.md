# Python Data Assignments Practice Workspace

## Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point for running or testing assignments.
- `assignments/`: Folder for all assignment scripts.
  - `assignment_template.py`: Template to use for new assignments.

## How to Use
1. Copy `assignments/assignment_template.py` and rename it for your new assignment (e.g., `assignment1.py`).
2. Fill in the assignment title, description, and your solution in the new file.
3. Run your assignment using:
   ```bash
   python assignments/assignment1.py
   ```
4. Use `main.py` as a launcher or for custom testing.

## Tips
- Keep each assignment in its own file for organization.
- Update this README as needed for your workflow.
